Help with quote,"I was working on a quote for a friend a bit ago and just need to know if this is accurate. So the new iPhone promos love em include iPhone 17s with port and no trade on the 4 for 100 plan the limit on the promotion is 4 However, my friend has 5 lines. He has two phones that will be doing the family freedom program. Since the phone gets traded in, in that situation anyway its a different promotion.

3 Weeks of Intermittent Connection,"A few weeks ago, we started experiencing what tech support representatives referred to as intermittent network disruptions in our area. Home internet and cell phone service both included. Customer service has not been able to give me any clear answers on when it will be resolved. After over a dozen phone calls over the last few weeks, I was finally told that the tower in our area is not able to be updated due to the owner of the land that the tower is on not allowing the technicians on to the property to complete the updates needed. Weve been with T-Mobile for over 3 years now and have loved it and never had an overnight change like this. Now I feel like Im getting the run around on whether or not they can even resolve the issue at any point in time. I work from home and Im losing income because I cannot stay connected. I cannot maintain a phone call, load a video on social media, stream Netflix, or run or update applications or games on my smart TVs or video game console. I have also willingly done every trouble shooting option with tech support available to me. Speed tests show a download speed of 4.53 Mbps and upload speeds of 0. We have had the gateway and our cellphones checked to make sure it wasnt a device issue too. Service works great everywhere but in our own neighborhood. Has anyone ever experienced any issue like this? Im slowly but surely losing hope of it improving and shopping around to see my options. Any suggestions appreciated. Thanks in advance.","3 Weeks of Intermittent Connection. A few weeks ago, we started experiencing what tech support representatives referred to as intermittent network disruptions in our area.

Refurbished Galaxy S24 Plus different CSCs,"Hi, I just bought a refurbished, carrier-unlocked Galaxy S24 SM-S926U from Back Market to replace my S21FE which I loved. I had previously bought one from Amazon, but it wouldnt download software updates, so I returned it instead of trying a firmware flash. I started this phone with my TMobile SIM already inserted, and everything updated. I can see it was originally a TMobile phone in the US, so Im not sure if this has anything to do with it. I used Phone Doctor to check the phones mechanics, and everything checked out well. Ive done an IMEI check, and nothing shows blacklisted or problematic. Its in almost new condition, and so far, everything seems to be working fine, and its great - and I want to buy refurbished phones if they work for me. But, I want to review a few things before fully committing to this phone and setting it all the way up, and wondering if someone could help. 1 My firmware build is the latest TMB build for SM-S926U, according to Samfw.com . But, my service provider software version shows TMBTMB,TMBXAUTMB Can anyone interpret this? I dont have much experience with CSC and firmware, but Ive done a lot of internet investigating and I havent seen five symbols three slashes before. Its my understanding that, going from left to right, the first is the CSC of the current firmware build, the second and third are separated by a comma to indicate the first and second SIM position CSCs, and typically the fourth is the last symbol that indicates the original CSC as manufactured and sold and cannot be changed. Is that correct? In this case, there is another slash and a fifth symbol. So, Im wondering if there is anything to be concerned about. Would it affect future software updates, or if I change carriers? 2 I want to use the phone in Ecuador next year, and Kimovil indicates the SM-S926U variant should have all the radio bands there. Does anyone know if I could have problems loading a SIM in Ecuador, or how I might go about finding out short of going and testing it out!?

Lost Free Line,"So earlier this year, I got picked to receive a free line. I took advantage of it via Facebook and they mailed me a SIM card. I put it in my desk drawer until I needed it. Fast forward to a week ago when I wanted to buy a phone to actually use the line. I noticed that it wasnt showing under my account.

T-Mobile vs Costco T-Mobile Financing ELI5,"So I have currently have 3 phone lines and 4 watch lines with Verizon and have been looking to switch to T-Mobile. One of the watches will become a phone line so porting in 4 phone numbers  3 watches. When I first checked with a T-mobile store and was given a promo for 1000 off each phone without trade-in and some deals on watches too. Cant remember but I think it was BoG 300off 2nd watch. There was no mention about a down payment or anything limiting the financing. I heard about the cash  Visa cards at Costco so I went there to check. Just about the first thing I heard was that theres a 3600 limit for financing so I would have to make a down payment.? However I assured I would still get the full thousand dollar credit for each of the phone lines. This is where I am confused. If I can only finance 3600 and credits stop once things are paid off, how do I get the full 4000? Also, is there a difference between Costcos T-Mobile finance limit vs a T-Mobile stores limit? Thanks for enlightening me.","T-Mobile vs Costco T-Mobile Financing ELI5. So I have currently have 3 phone lines and 4 watch lines with Verizon and have been looking to switch to T-Mobile.

Advice On How to Unscrew Myself My Phone Number In Limbo,"Some of this is more of a carrier question, I know, but I really just need advice on how to proceed. Bullet points of important details AND UPDATE at the end Recently, I got an iPhone 14 Pro Max new phone from my dad. Its a hammy down and he was using it for two years with T-Mobile. The device Im upgrading FROM is a IPhones 7 old phone, Ive had it for about 6 years and Ive had the same number attached to it the whole time. The goal is to keep that number. When trying to transfer between devices there was no problem except for the phone numbercell data. Apparently the new phone had been locked and the most reasonable conclusion after talking to my own provider, Straight Talk was to call T-Mobile to unlock it because my dad had been using it on the new phone just fine so obviously they had some control. I had my dad call them, and they say they unlocked it. Which seemed to be the case because now the phone would recognize the transfer instead of immediately suggesting I transfer using a phone with an updated IOS. Also note My old phone has only been able to get up to 15.8.something as of this morning. So heres the problem. I try doing it on my own again, and tell MY carriers automated machine that Im ready to transfer, but upon clicking Set Up on the new device a error pops up This eSIM cannot be supported or transferred, please contact your carrier for more details. So as I had done before I call mine first for advice, its not the same woman but she tries her best. She guarantees that number is safe which is awesome but because we cant authenticate my account I would have to set up the eSIM somehow. Another note I made the pin to authenticate my account a little bit after I got it. On my own. In middle school. During Covid. The only way Id remember is by troubleshooting the very few numbers I WOULDVE used back then. Im willing to do that, but after eight tries, she was not, Anyway, I talk to T-Mobile and theyre telling ME they say the iMEI number wasnt associated with them, whichI cannot even guess what that means for me, but I doubt its true. But she said if the phones still saying its locked despite what I said happened then she couldnt help. ANYWAY I lied before. Trying to transfer on my own wasnt my dumbest moment. My dumbest moment was FACTORY RESETTING MY PHONE to help it recognize it has been unlocked. NOW it doesnt even give me any other option besides scanning a QR code, setting up manually, or transferring from an IOS 16 device.  Got a phone from my dad  Everything transferred but the number  I call my carrier. Apparently its locked. We assume Tmobile because thats my dads carrier. They say call back once its unlocked.  He calls. They say they unlocked it.  I try transferring my number on my own. I get hit with another eSIM not supported but were further than before so thats good.  I call my carrier. I cant authenticate because I moved my number off my old phone. They say I need to set up the eSIM then come back  I call TMobile. They claim the device wasnt even associated with them, which I call BS.  Then I FACTORY RESET IT and omg I literally cant justify why I thought itd do any goodI thought itd help recognize the phone being unlocked.  The phone doesnt even recognize the progress I made before. Now Im here. With my number in limbo and no real way to proceed. If you guys can even just tell me who to talk to next that would be great. Update After visiting Apple in my local mall, they were able to identify that T-Mobile had NOT completely unlocked my device. So I was sent down to T-Mobile and spoke to a very nice woman about it and after being put on my dads account as an authorized user we made a call and it turns out the reason my device hadnt been completely freed was because of a payment my dad missed. Yeah. Anyway about 140 dollars in the hole BUT thats not all because after calling Straight Talk, it turns out my carrier hasnt been able to carry over is because there is an outage? Gonna look more into what that is but it means that Ill have to wait another 2-3 days before anything changes. Which means the problem is on hiatus.","Advice On How to Unscrew Myself My Phone Number In Limbo. Some of this is more of a carrier question, I know, but I really just need advice on how to proceed.

Cant sign up for T-Mobile,"Trying to sign up online for T-Mobile because Verizon service has gotten progressively worse at our home to the point where its unusable.

I understand that my consent is not a condition of purchasing any goods or services, and that I may revoke it at any time. I dont want that.

I dont really need more than one phone line, but its a definite possibility down the road in the near future so if it makes sense to take advantage of any deals or promos now Im willing to do that. I see the essentials deal, but Ill need a few more inclusions than that plan. I know its new lines for these deals, but could I do the three line option where the third line is free and port my existing number to that third line? Since its a free line, I dont know if thats a workaround so I can still keep my current number and port that in since her plan will be losing a line. Whats my best option right now?

I can go either consumer or business. Im interested in a tablet line and maybe also a hotspot. I dont really need more than one phone line, but its a definite possibility down the road in the near future so if it makes sense to take advantage of any deals or promos now Im willing to do that. I see the essentials deal, but Ill need a few more inclusions than that plan. I know its new lines for these deals, but could I do the three line option where the third line is free and port my existing number to that third line? Since its a free line, I dont know if thats a workaround so I can still keep my current number and port that in since her plan will be losing a line. Whats my best option right now? Im assuming going to Costco or Sams is still the best bet as well. Edit staying on my wifes plan is not an option for various reasons. This will cost me what it costs me, Im just trying to get the best deal out of it",1.0,Positive

Can I port a number from Verizon to T-Mobile that is tied up in pending changes wVerizon?,"Completely frustrated with Verizon. Ordered 4 lines to upgrade and for 3.5 weeks, 1 line has been stuck and the new phone hasnt shipped. No one can fix it at Verizon. I need to port 4 numbers from Verizon, 1 number is tied up in pending changes. So, 3 lines have been processed, 1 is stuck. Of the 3 processed - only 1 phone was sent back as a trade-in. I have possession of the upgraded phones for the other 2 lines but neither has been activated because Im trying to figure out my next move here. Id like to cancelreturn the 3 upgraded phones we received, within the 30 day return policy, and port all 4 numbers over to TMobile. Im hoping that cancelling the entire order of 4 upgrades will release the 1 that is stuck wont be pending changes anymore, it will be cancelled. If for some reason, that doesnt unstick the 1 number....is it possible to port it anyway? What would stop a number from being ported? ETA One of the upgraded phones is still within the 30 return window. I dont mind eating some restocking fees, but the 1,100 17 pro cost of the phone, if I decide to keep it gives me pause. Option 1 Keep the new phone and bring to TMO. This involves paying 100 of the phone cost as it was a free trade-in . Option 2 Return the new phone within the 30 day window. Issue here is then this line will not have a phone for however long it takes Verizon to accept and process the returns on my account, because I returned the OG phone as a trade-in and zero chance of getting it back, its already been processed, too.","Can I port a number from Verizon to T-Mobile that is tied up in pending changes wVerizon?.

The T-Mo docs seem to imply that I just need to follow the prompts while setup on the Pixel 10 pro and everything will be kosher once I connect to a wifi. But I am very skeptical that it will this easy. Any advice is appreciated, dont want to get stuck in between with a deactivated 7 pro and a 10 pro that does not setup from psim to esim Thanks",1.0,Positive
How often do they have a free line promo?,"Took too long to call in for the free line promo email I received and was told its no longer available. Was thinking of using that line to get my son his first phone for xmas. Anyone know how often they run this promo? Think itll happen again before Xmas, or maybe his bday in April?","How often do they have a free line promo?.

"So, T-Mobile straight up full on lied to me. What are my options?","tldr I was placed into a multi year contract via phone without it being explained to me. What are my options? 1. In 2024, I was wildly overcharged for reasons that werent explained to me clearly. I called in one day with an intention to close my account. I was offered a lower rate plan. No fine print. No documentation. No disclosures. I said yes. 2. Fast forward to today. I needed new phones. I was eligible. I went to the store to pick them up. IT TOOK THREE HOURS for them to do the account research and let me know that the lower rate plan was a multi year lock in. With no Equipment Financing. 3. T-Mobile wants to charge me 700 per line to switch my plan even if I stay with TMobile. In order to get device financing. And they have stated Im completely locked into my current contract. 4. I was so livid. The people in the store and on the phone did their best. Everyone acknowledged that this is bullshit and they dont understand how this exists. 5. I am 100000 done with T-Mobile. I have been a customer for over a decade. Theyve gotten unreasonably bad. I am leaving no matter what. Questions - What can I do here? - Do you know of anyone else like ATTVerizon buying out contracts? Thank you Bill","So, T-Mobile straight up full on lied to me.

I opened 3 Fanatics Topps 25-26 Blaster Boxes,"Insane amount of hits. 2 coopers, 1 rookie relic, 1 numbered card, 8 parallels, lots of rookie base, and a shit tonne of fun. If I miscounted my pulls, please forgive me.","I opened 3 Fanatics Topps 25-26 Blaster Boxes.

Essentials Add Ons?,"Sorry if this has already been answered but I couldnt find it spelled out clearly - If I want to set up 4 lines on the Essentials plan but want more advanced features on just my line, is it possible to do that via add-ons or upgrades? E.g. if I want the features of Beyond but the other users who are on my plan dont need that, is there any way to do that?","Essentials Add Ons?.
