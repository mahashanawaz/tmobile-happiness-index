Anyone with fiber have issues with Nintendo switch online?,"My friend said the network uses CGNAT and I may have difficulty with tmobile/metronets fiber when using switch online. I also torrent at times and he said that could be an issue too?

Just curious what your experience has been. We had a new install in my neighborhood. Can't beat the 10 year price guarantee or the unlimited data. I went over 50gb last month and paid and extra $60 with my current provider. "
Help with quote,"I was working on a quote for a friend a bit ago and just need to know if this is accurate. 

So the new iPhone promos (love em) include iPhone 17s with port and no trade on the 4 for $100 plan the limit on the promotion is 4 However, my friend has 5 lines. He has two phones that will be doing the family freedom program. Since the phone gets traded in, in that situation anyway it’s a different promotion.  Are those two promotions combinable and would he be able to get all 5 phones on promotion? 3 no trade port, and 2 with trade?

Thanks in advance to anyone who can help. "

Porting Out Question,"I'm looking to port out to AT&T while they're offering up to $800/line to switch from a competitor. 



My main question is when and how will I get the final bill? How will my current phone get unlocked when porting out? I've only been with T-Mobile for about 5 months, but service in my workplace isn't great, so need to switch back to AT&T. 

  
I know AT&T isn't paying for my final bill - which means I will fork out the money first to pay off and get reimbursed, but my main concern would be collections after reading some horror stories for port out/closing accounts. "
Need help with phone unlocking,My grandmother paid for her iPhone fully before getting on a T-Mobile plan with my aunt. My grandmother has since bought a new phone through ATT and had given my younger brother her carrier locked phone. Is there any way we can get the fully paid iPhone unlocked from the carrier (T-Mobile)?
Struggling with T-Mobile Still…,"I cannot for the life of me get my PlayStation portal to work with my IPhone 16 pro hotspot - either for cloud gaming or remote play.

-Hotspot is through TMobile, which a lot of people have said you have to do network setting manually- tried that, no luck

-iOS is up to date 

-no luck when I turn on or off max compatibility

If anyone has any advice I’d love to hear it, thank you in advance!! "
3 Weeks of “Intermittent” Connection,"A few weeks ago, we started experiencing what tech support representatives referred to as “intermittent” network disruptions in our area. Home internet and cell phone service both included. Customer service has not been able to give me any clear answers on when it will be resolved. After over a dozen phone calls over the last few weeks, I was finally told that the tower in our area is not able to be updated due to the owner of the land that the tower is on not allowing the technicians on to the property to complete the updates needed. We’ve been with T-Mobile for over 3 years now and have loved it and never had an overnight change like this. Now I feel like I’m getting the run around on whether or not they can even resolve the issue at any point in time. I work from home and I’m losing income because I cannot stay connected. I cannot maintain a phone call, load a video on social media, stream Netflix, or run or update applications or games on my smart TV’s or video game console. I have also willingly done every trouble shooting option with tech support available to me. Speed tests show a download speed of 4.53 Mbps and upload speeds of 0. We have had the gateway and our cellphones checked to make sure it wasn’t a device issue too. Service works great everywhere but in our own neighborhood. Has anyone ever experienced any issue like this? I’m slowly but surely losing hope of it improving and shopping around to see my options. Any suggestions appreciated. Thanks in advance. "
Just got rid of Hulu Live TV,"We found we were hardly watching live tv anymore. Instead, we have the Hulu, Disney+, and ESPN Unlimited all with ads with HBO Max, Starz, and Showtime/Paramount+ add ons. Our bill went from $123 to $56 (We get a $7 rebate by paying for Hulu with my Blue Cash AMEX card). We also have Prime Video, AMC+, Netflix, Apple TV+ from Tmobile, and Peacock through Walmart+. There’s also Pluto and Tubi TV. If my husband can still get his fill of sports broadcasts, we will probably keep it at this."

Refurbished Galaxy S24 Plus different CSCs,"Hi, I just bought a refurbished, carrier-unlocked Galaxy S24+ (SM-S926U) from Back Market to replace my S21FE (which I loved). I had previously bought one from Amazon, but it wouldn't download software updates, so I returned it instead of trying a firmware flash.

I started this phone with my TMobile SIM already inserted, and everything updated. I can see it was originally a TMobile phone in the US, so I'm not sure if this has anything to do with it. I used Phone Doctor to check the phone's mechanics, and everything checked out well. I've done an IMEI check, and nothing shows blacklisted or problematic. It's in almost new condition, and so far, everything seems to be working fine, and it's great - and I want to buy refurbished phones if they work for me. But, I want to review a few things before fully committing to this phone and setting it all the way up, and wondering if someone could help.

(1) My firmware build is the latest TMB build for SM-S926U, according to [Samfw.com](https://samfw.com/firmware/SM-S926U) . But, my service provider software version shows:

TMB/TMB,TMB/XAU/TMB

Can anyone interpret this? I don't have much experience with CSC and firmware, but I've done a lot of internet investigating and I haven't seen five symbols (three slashes) before. It's my understanding that, going from left to right, the first is the CSC of the current firmware build, the second and third are separated by a comma to indicate the first and second SIM position CSC's, and typically the fourth is the last symbol that indicates the original CSC as manufactured and sold and cannot be changed. Is that correct? In this case, there is another slash and a fifth symbol. So, I'm wondering if there is anything to be concerned about. Would it affect future software updates, or if I change carriers?

(2) I want to use the phone in Ecuador next year, and [Kimovil indicates](https://www.kimovil.com/en/frequency-checker/EC/samsung-galaxy-s24-plus) the SM-S926U variant should have all the radio bands there. Does anyone know if I could have problems loading a SIM in Ecuador, or how I might go about finding out (short of going and testing it out!)?

Thanks for any help!"
Changing Carrier in a Poor Service Area,"I’ve had Verizon for over a decade but it was through a family plan and my parents paid. This arrangement is coming to an end and I need to secure my own plan (don’t want to continue with Verizon if possible). The problem is that i live in a rural area with poor coverage so I need to determine that an alternative company will provide equal or better coverage to Verizon. Would any of you brainiacs know the simplest way to go about this. I am completely ignorant about “burner” phones, but assumed this would be a way to try out TMobile, ATT, etc. without committing to a contract and hoping it’ll work. Any better ideas out there?"
iPhone upgrade at Apple,"Can I upgrade my iPhone at Apple when I still have a $500 balance owed on the go5gplus plan 12 out of 24 credits applied.  Tmobiles page shows I still owe the $500 but Apple doesn’t.  

What’s the deal? Can I upgrade at Apple without having to pay off the $500 balance?  The Apple website only asks for tax but doesn’t ask for the remaining balance.

Old Simple Choice Free Tablet Line - How much data should I be getting?,"I have an old ""Free On Us"" tablet line from years ago. It's been dormant in a old Netgear LTE modem for a long time racking up $1.40 fees every month.

I picked up a 5G Inseego modem for cheap to see if it'd work - and it does! I'm getting 20-100 mBit throughput in my testing. 

Curiously, I've pulled in over 20 GB of data at those speeds according to my monitor app. The line is ""Simple Choice North America 6GB MI"". Did that get un-capped when the Simple-Choice uncapping happened a few years ago? Any Caveats?"

T-Mobile eSim bites,"I got a Pixel 10 on one line, which forced me to get an eSim on that line. I was assured that eSim swapping is trivial. It was trivial to deactivate the physical sim and put it on this line.

However, today, I tried to move that eSim to a Samsung Fold 3 phone. When I try I get a message that I have to call T-Mobile and give them Support Code 511 (which is basically, problem with eSim movement). eSim is not locked. (Triple checked).

The Pixel 10 is T-Mobile locked. The Fold 3 is unlocked (and I've used it many times on T-Mobile with physical sim).   
  
I call T-Mobile and get a message--after waiting 10 minutes, that there's a ""25 minute wait"" ahead.

Screw that, I have stuff to do.

WTF. So eSim is basically a dumpster file, just as I worried when I switched?"
Go5G+ user who signed up for Hulu ON US almost a year ago: Am I going to still get Hulu for free after 12 months is up? Or will they start charging me automatically?,"[This is what my \\""Manage add-ons\\"" page shows.](https://preview.redd.it/hzbsbfpkc30g1.png?width=570&format=png&auto=webp&s=7653c992fa69bfc0649f444cec5df419454f1f0d)

My understanding is, normally you need the Go5G Next plan to get Hulu for free, but T-Mobile gave it to people on Go5G Plus who already ""Netflix On Us"" enabled as of 1/5/2024. Not sure if they just gave it to us for free for 12 months, or if I'll continue to get it for free even with Go5G+ plan."
Google fi to tmobile on 4/100 promo,My question is that online it lets me complete the purchase even though its from google fi but when i went to sams to avoid the fees guy said google fi doesn't work for this deal which makes sense. If i complete the purchase online will they catch it later that its from google fi and jack the price up on me or take away the free phones?
Getting ripped off by Tmobile,"I switched to Metro By Tmobile on October 14th at a store location. I was told I’d have a hotspot on unlimited $30 plan and it was a lie. So today November 8th I have finally gotten the extra cash to go back to Tmobile and get my old hotspot plan back.

I was told by the Tmobile store I went to today that if I called customer service they would reimburse me for cost of activation fee and SIM card by putting credits on my account for my next months phone bill.

I had to pay $10 activation fee and $10 for a new SIM card. I was told my old Tmobile sim which I brought was invalid.

So I call the customer service and the lady tells me they can’t do this. I asked to speak with a manager and she tells me manager is busy and would call me back.

I’m still waiting.

What can I do? I’ve been with Tmobile since 2013 and only left because they wouldn’t give me a cheaper phone plan and the Metro store said their $30 unlimited plan was exactly the same as Tmobile $50 prepaid.

I’m so angry right now. Boost and Verizon said I couldn’t keep my same number that’s the only reason I came back to this company and to be treated this way.

How to get a refund,"I switched to Metro on October 14th at a store location. I was told I’d have a hotspot and it was a lie. So today November 8th I have finally gotten the extra cash to go back to Tmobile and get my old hotspot plan back.

My question is can I get a refund for the 6 days I didn’t use? I switched my original phone number from t mobile to metro and now back to Tmobile. So from what I was told the account should be canceled now.

Is there a email? If not should I use LinkedIn to find someone who works at metro and ask them? What should I do? 

I also want to ask them to reimburse for activation charges on Tmobile as I had to pay $10 activation fee and $10 for a new SIM card."
Will T-Mobile ever offer a free Iphone upgrade to Advantage Unlimited users?,"I was moved from Sprint SERO to the now, 'legacy' T-Mobile ""Advantage Unlimited"" plan a few years ago and want to stay on this plan.

T-Mobile data not working on roaming abroad while full 5G or LTE - Mexico or Madagaskar,"Hey I have Go5G Next Data plan and I have problems with T-Mobile when I travel abroad. First time it was in Madagaskar 3 months ago. There was many times when I had full bars LTE service and it was not working. It only happened to work on 3G data. 
Now I am in Mexico, I have full bars 5G at the airport and I can’t connect to any website. I’m connected to Telcel.
During my travel in Mexico, the internet was on and off on my device with T- Mobile. It’s very frustrating for the amount I pay monthly and it doesn’t work as it should…
Anyone experienced these problems? Any fix for that? I also have iPhone 15 if that matters. "
Lost Free Line,"So earlier this year, I got picked to receive a free line. I took advantage of it via Facebook and they mailed me a SIM card. I put it in my desk drawer until I needed it.  

Fast forward to a week ago when I wanted to buy a phone to actually use the line. I noticed that it wasn't showing under my account. I reached out to Tforce, and apparently there was an activation error on their end, which no one made me aware of, so now I have no free line. 

Since the promotion is gone, they said there's no way for them to fix it, so they offered me six months of free service if I add a line. I asked to speak to a supervisor, but was told that they were aware of their mistake, and that was the best they could do. 

I ended up complaining on the survey they sent me, so I got an email from someone. While deciding what to do, they called me and offered me an additional year of free service for the line, bringing it to 18 months. I appreciate it, but that doesn't come close to the savings of a free line! 

So should I try pushing this further? I know it was a free line and didn't cost me anything, but it was their mistake and I feel like they should give me what I was promised. 

Thanks!"
T-Mobile vs Costco T-Mobile Financing ELI5,"So I have currently have 3 phone lines and 4 watch lines with Verizon and have been looking to switch to T-Mobile.  One of the watches will become a phone line so porting in 4 phone numbers & 3 watches.

When I first checked with a T-mobile store and was given a promo for $1000 off each phone without trade-in and some deals on watches too. (Can’t remember but I think it was BoG $300off 2nd watch).  There was no mention about a down payment or anything limiting the financing.

I heard about the cash & Visa cards at Costco so I went there to check.  Just about the first thing I heard was that there’s a $3600 limit for financing so I would have to make a down payment.(?)  However I assured I would still get the full thousand dollar credit for each of the phone lines.  

This is where I am confused.  If I can only finance $3600 and credits stop once things are paid off, how do I get the full $4000?

Also, is there a difference between Costco’s T-Mobile finance limit vs a T-Mobile store’s limit?

Thanks for enlightening me."

Advice On How to Unscrew Myself (My Phone Number In Limbo),"Some of this is more of a carrier question, I know, but I really just need advice on how to proceed. (Bullet points of important details AND UPDATE at the end)

Recently, I got an iPhone 14 Pro Max (new phone) from my dad. It’s a hammy down and he was using it for two years with T-Mobile.

The device I’m upgrading FROM is a IPhones 7 (old phone), I’ve had it for about 6 years and I’ve had the same number attached to it the whole time. The goal is to keep that number.

When trying to transfer between devices there was no problem except for the phone number/cell data. Apparently the new phone had been locked and the most reasonable conclusion (after talking to my own provider, Straight Talk) was to call T-Mobile to unlock it because my dad had been using it on the new phone just fine so obviously they had some control.

I had my dad call them, and they say they unlocked it. Which seemed to be the case because now the phone would recognize the transfer instead of immediately suggesting I transfer using a phone with an updated IOS. 

Also note: My old phone has only been able to get up to 15.8.something as of this morning. 

So here’s the problem. I try doing it on my own again, and tell MY carrier’s automated machine that I’m ready to transfer, but upon clicking “Set Up” on the new device a error pops up:

“This eSIM cannot be supported or transferred, please contact your carrier for more details.”

So as I had done before I call mine first for advice, it’s not the same woman but she tries her best. She guarantees that number is safe (which is awesome) but because we can’t authenticate my account I would have to set up the eSIM somehow.

Another note: I made the pin to authenticate my account a little bit after I got it. On my own. In middle school. During Covid. The only way I’d “remember” is by troubleshooting the very few numbers I WOULDVE used back then. I’m willing to do that, but after eight tries, she was not,

Anyway, I talk to T-Mobile and they’re telling ME they say the iMEI number wasn’t associated with them, which…I cannot even guess what that means for me, but I doubt it’s true. But she said if the phones still saying it’s locked despite what I said happened then she couldn’t help.

ANYWAY I lied before. Trying to transfer on my own wasn’t my dumbest moment. My dumbest moment was  FACTORY RESETTING MY PHONE to help it recognize it has been unlocked. 

NOW it doesn’t even give me any other option besides scanning a QR code, setting up manually, or  transferring from an IOS 16 device.

* Got a phone from my dad
* Everything transferred but the number
* I call my carrier. Apparently it’s locked. We assume Tmobile because that’s my dad’s carrier. They say call back once it’s unlocked.
* He calls. They say they unlocked it.
* I try transferring my number on my own. I get hit with another “eSIM not supported” but we’re further than before so that’s good.
* I call my carrier. I can’t authenticate because I moved my number off my old phone. They say I need to set up the eSIM then come back
* I call TMobile. They claim the device wasn’t even associated with them, which I call BS.
* Then I FACTORY RESET IT and omg I literally can’t justify why I thought it’d do any good…I thought it’d help recognize the phone being unlocked.
* The phone doesn’t even recognize the progress I made before.

Now I’m here. With my number in limbo and no real way to proceed. If you guys can even just tell me who to talk to next that would be great.

Update: After visiting Apple in my local mall, they were able to identify that T-Mobile had NOT completely unlocked my device. So I was sent down to T-Mobile and spoke to a very nice woman about it and— after being put on my dad’s account as an authorized user— we made a call and it turns out the reason my device hadn’t been completely freed was because of a payment my dad missed. 

Yeah.

Anyway about 140 dollars in the hole BUT that’s not all because after calling Straight Talk, it turns out my carrier hasn’t been able to carry over is because there is an outage? Gonna look more into what that is but it means that I’ll have to wait another 2-3 days before anything changes.

Which means the problem is on hiatus."

New account via Costco,"Hi all, just signed up for T-Mobile via Costco yesterday. I got the Experience Beyond plan for 3 lines: 2 paid, 1 free and 3 iPhone 17 Pro’s with $1,000 credit (no trade-in required).

The Costco rep told me the max credit approval was always limited to $3600 for new accounts so I could only get 3 lines with the new phones. The only alternative was to open a business account which I did not do.

My questions are:

1. I want to bring over 2 additional lines from AT&T, how do I do this with the $3600 equipment credit cap?
2. Since my account is new and I get one free line, can I not take advantage of another BOGO right now?
3. If I can use another BOGO, what code do I need to give the reps?
4. I got 20% off added, will doing a BOGO mess that up?"

How do I use my iPhone voicemail greeting instead of T-Mobile’s?,"When I go into my iPhone phone app > Voicemail > Greeting and select Default, I get a really clear-sounding generic greeting that doesn’t mention my name or phone number. However, after selecting this, it doesn’t stick. When someone calls me, they get the T-Mobile voicemail greeting, which sounds really scratchy like it’s coming from 1000 miles away and speaks my phone number, which is the most anonymous T-Mobile option that was available.

Strangely, my wife’s iPhone, which is exactly the same as mine and is on the exact same rate plan as mine with the same features, plays the iPhone greeting when you call her phone.

How do I get my phone to play the iPhone greeting instead of the T-Mobile greeting?"
Question about device payoff when switching.,I want to take advantage of the device payoff for people switching to T-Mobile.

Do I have to show them how much is due on the device at the time I port my number or can I pay the device off a day or two before and bring in the receipt from the device payoff. What exactly do I have to provide to get that reimbursement?

It's greyed out because there are three buttons at the bottom, all of which must be checked. And the middle one says:

""By checking this box, I agree that T-Mobile, or others acting on its behalf, may call or text me at the number provided above to receive updates and offers, and that they may use an autodialer, artificial voices, or pre-recordings to do so. I understand that my consent is not a condition of purchasing any goods or services, and that I may revoke it at any time.""

I don't want that. And it specifically says consent is not a condition of purchase. But the form won't submit unless it's checked, so it sure seems like it is.

I also found that the iPad and smartwatch plans were automatically put on the most expensive plan in the cart, with no way to change or edit that. It also limited me to switching 5 lines, though that's a much smaller problem. (Depending on what Verizon does when the main phone on the account gets switched away and the only devices left are two iPads and a watch.)

So I wanted to ask if there was a way to fix that and sign up without consenting to robocalls.

When I tried to use the online customer service, the person said he could not help me unless I filled out a form first. The form asked for a lot of personal information and had several additional tabs one of which made it look like it was going to ask for ID.

...and the form had a link to a privacy policy saying the information collected would be used and sold for marketing purposes.

I know all these companies all sell data right and left, but that felt excessive & intrusive just to ask a couple of questions, so I bailed at that point.

Is there, in fact, any way to sign up for service without consenting to robocalls, preferably while also obtaining the $10/mo plans for tablets and watches?

Cell Phone Protection after tmo loophole closed,"Does anyone here use the Bilt card to pay their cell phone bill (but do it using a routing / account number so the carrier sees it as a bank account)?

TMobile just closed a loop hole where customers would manually pay the bill with a credit card before it was due. They still received autopay discount (basically $5/line).

Now you can't do that anymore. Curious if similar to how the rent payments work if we can do something similar for paying TMobile bill?"
Advice for best Holiday Deal,"I've held out and waited for any holiday deals that are available, so I guess now is the time.

I'm already on T-Mobile on my wife's plan and I'm happy with my current S22 Ultra, so I don't really need a phone per se, but if I do, it will be Samsung. I'm leaving her plan and getting my own.

I can go either consumer or business.

I'm interested in a tablet line and maybe also a hotspot.

I don't really need more than one phone line, but it's a definite possibility down the road in the near future so if it makes sense to take advantage of any deals or promos now I'm willing to do that. 

I see the essentials deal, but I'll need a few more inclusions than that plan. 

I know it's new lines for these deals, but could I do the three line option where the third line is free and port my existing number to that third line? Since it's a free line, I don't know if that's a workaround so I can still keep my current number and port that in since her plan will be losing a line.

What's my best option right now? I'm assuming going to Costco or Sam's is still the best bet as well.

Edit: staying on my wife's plan is not an option for various reasons. This will cost me what it costs me, I'm just trying to get the best deal out of it."
AT&T roaming in East Texas still active,"

T-Mobile Is Handing Out Free Flagship Phones For The Holidays,

What is a good T-Mobile hotspot device to make sure of cell phone connectivity in the boonies?,"Most of what I've found seems like devices for laptops only, but we will need to ensure connectivity via cell phone in places where only T-Mobile seems to have signal.

Trade in terms expires TOMORROW,"I’m upgrading an iPhone 15, trading in the device, online order.  When I view the “Trade in Terms” document, it has my device details listed with an expiration date of TOMORROW.  
Also:
“If you fail to return your Device by the trade-in expiration date, you may be required to pay back any value or credit advanced to you.”

The new device isn’t even going to ship for a couple days, so the expiration date makes no sense.  
I shouldn’t agree to this and abandon the order, right?!?"
Anyone have the Revvl 8?,"Got this phone a few days ago. It seems decent so far. Only thing that's getting at me is photos. It seems there's so many folders the photos get put into.

Now it seems I need a treasure map to locate photos. It's annoying, or am I doing something wrong??"
Can I port a number from Verizon to T-Mobile that is tied up in pending changes w/Verizon?,"Completely frustrated with Verizon.  Ordered 4 lines to upgrade and for 3.5 weeks, 1 line has been stuck and the new phone hasn't shipped.  No one can fix it at Verizon.

I need to port 4 numbers from Verizon, 1 number is tied up in pending changes.  So, 3 lines have been processed, 1 is stuck.

Of the 3 processed - only 1 phone was sent back as a trade-in.  I have  possession of the upgraded phones for the other 2 lines but neither has been activated because I'm trying to figure out my next move here.

I'd like to cancel/return the 3 upgraded phones we received, within the 30 day return policy, and port all 4 numbers over to TMobile.  I'm hoping that cancelling the entire order of 4 upgrades will release the 1 that is stuck (won't be pending changes anymore, it will be cancelled).

If for some reason, that doesn't unstick the 1 number....is it possible to port it anyway?  What would stop a number from being ported?

  
ETA:  One of the upgraded phones is still within the 30 return window.   I don't mind eating some restocking fees, but the $1,100 (17 pro) cost of the phone, if I decide to keep it  gives me pause.

Option 1:  Keep the new phone and bring to TMO.  This involves paying 100% of the phone cost (as it was a ""free"" trade-in) .

Option 2:  Return the new phone within the 30 day window.  Issue here is then this line will not have a phone for however long it takes Verizon to accept and process the returns on my account, because I returned the OG phone as a trade-in and zero chance of getting it back, it's already been processed, too."

Not for existing customers?,"I have the Go5G Next plan, I have an iPhone 15 Pro, all paid off.

Considering switching,"Hi I’m considering switching to T-Mobile.  It would just be one line, need a new phone (iPhone 17, usually do the the pro max’s but probably down sizing with this next phone).  May get a new iPad and upgrade my watch with them but don’t necessarily need internet on either, so it just depends on if it makes sense to or not.  As far as streaming, I have Hulu for free through Spotify.  Don’t use Disney.  Already have access to Netflix.

What would you recommend for me as far as plans go?"
New tablets,"New tablets

I currently have a pair of (32gb) Galaxy Tab A7+ on my account that are quite old and slowing down. They’re used by my kids for streaming video and learning apps like ABC Mouse, plus they like to take pictures with them which absolutely fill the onboard memory.

We are currently on the Go5GPlus plan and are locked in for another 11 months due to our phone promotions. 

I stopped by a local authorized retailer who said they have Galaxy Tab A9+5G available, but there’s no upgrade promotions - only for new lines.

QUESTIONS

— Is it true you now have to avoid any line removals for six months instead of three months to keep a new line promo?
— She suggested moving the insurance to the new tablets since the old ones won’t be in use anymore, and then she could put the old tablets on a lower plan, doing that would result in our bill only going up about seven dollars a month until the old tablets are removed, then our bill would actually drop lower than where it is now.
(she told me this, she did not show me anything on paper)
— I don’t see any tablet plan options for the new ones that would save money compared to our current plans, how can our bill end up going lower?

Phone insurance through new T-Mobile Credit Card?,"So I, like many here, have been doing the autopay loophole that T-Mobile just closed up.

What is interesting is it doesn't say anything about phone insurance, however it does say you get all the Visa Signature perks which does include phone insurance...

I’ve got a quick question about Magenta upgrades (we’re on a veteran/military plan, if that makes a difference).

If it’s expected to come back, he’s happy to wait. If not, he’ll go ahead and upgrade now.

Anyone have any insight or predictions? Thanks in advance! 🙏

Best Card For Utility/MTA & T-Mobile(?),"**RESOLVED**

So I need a card that can preferably get me 5% on utilities (Con Edison) and public transit (MTA). I currently have Future card.

I’ve only heard bad things about Elan Financial but does their issues apply to me? I’m only going to spend like $600 a month.

Lastly, does T-Mobile take Discover for their 1%. Still want autopay 


Thanks All. I will be getting USBank+ and TMobile CC (sometime down the line since I need to get Venture X first)

Switching from Verizon (iPhone 11). What are the best deals or trade-in offers right now for new iPhone?,"I have been with Verizon for over 15 years. I have an iPhone 11 (regular version) that’s paid off. My monthly plan at Verizon is about $115/month, unlimited data (Internet and texting) it’s the 5G Play More Plan. Would be fine with a comparable or better plan if it’s similar cost or less. 

Verizon has its own upgrade offer, but I think I’d like to switch carriers. Not sure if T-Mobile or AT&T is better. I need a new phone as well, ideally the new iPhone 17.

If I go through T-Mobile, what’s the best deal I could do? And would the new phone be carrier locked? Not sure if I should do T-Mobile or AT&T or something through Costco. 
"
Wanted to switch to T-Mobile today (almost did) but it’s more expensive than Verizon,"Kinda bummed that T-Mobile is the new Verizon in terms of cost and Verizon is cheaper now. Got all the way to the port progress before canceling. Went through Costco and was getting 225 in Costco cards and 500 in prepaid visa which is a pretty good deal for BYOD. The reason why I pulled it is the T-Mobile rep said 225 for my 2 experience beyond lines, 2 watches and an iPad while I pay Verizon $185 for UU, UP, 2 watches, iPad  and Xbox game pass with Verizon. The Costco rep said it would be around $193.

Man, what T-Mobile is doing is the opposite of what they used to he despite their network improvements. On the flip side, I can switch to att with my bundled fiber and pay $140 for equivalent services. 

Probably end up sticking with Verizon now. While Verizon isn’t the best anymore, they are improving and solid overall, especially at a cheaper price point than T-Mobile. 

Edit: we have 17’s that we bought from Apple. We get Apple TV from Apple one premier. Disney Hulu bundle with $10 credit with the Amex BCP. Netflix we pay for no ads. Could I get Netflix with ads and upgrade and pay the difference?"
Credits? Let me get your thoughts as a customer,"Hypothetically, if I’m able to see credits on your account and if I can see when your credits are going to fall off, would you want me to let you know ahead of time that your credits were coming to an end and if so, and my only solution is for you to call customer service. Would you appreciate that or not or would you maybe be possibly hassle me and tell me that I should fix that even though there is no way for me to do that from my end?"
$20 off Per Month/1 year,"Head to chat on T-Life and tell them you are switching to a MVNO that will save you $60 per month.

Google Pixel 7pro (unlocked) psim to Google Pixel 10 pro esim on T-Mobile Questions,"Hello All,

I have an existing T-Mo psim on my current Pixel 7 pro and purchased a new Pixel 10 pro in the US (which only has esim). Is it easy to convert the psim to an esim during the process of setting up the Pixel 10 pro? I have the T-life app setup on the Pixel 7 pro already. Can this conversion and move be done during the Pixel 10 Pro setup or will I have to visit the store or call customer service to make this happen? Or should I convert the psim to esim on the Pixel 7 pro first and then only then do an esim based 7 pro to 10 pro transfer? The T-Mo docs seem to imply that I just need to follow the prompts while setup on the Pixel 10 pro and everything will be kosher once I connect to a wifi. But I am very skeptical that it will this easy. Any advice is appreciated, dont want to get stuck in between with a deactivated 7 pro and a 10 pro that does not setup from psim to esim

"So, T-Mobile straight up full on lied to me. What are my options?","tldr; I was placed into a multi year contract via phone without it being explained to me. What are my options?

1. In 2024, I was wildly overcharged for reasons that weren't explained to me clearly. I called in one day with an intention to close my account. I was offered ""a lower rate plan"". No fine print. No documentation. No disclosures. I said yes.
2. Fast forward to today. I needed new phones. I was eligible. I went to the store to pick them up. IT TOOK THREE HOURS for them to do the account research and let me know that the ""lower rate plan"" was a multi year lock in. With no Equipment Financing.
3. T-Mobile wants to charge me $700 per line to switch my plan even if I stay with TMobile. In order to get device financing. And they have stated I'm completely locked into my current contract.
4. I was so livid. The people in the store and on the phone did their best. Everyone acknowledged that this is bullshit and they don't understand how this exists.
5. I am 100000% done with T-Mobile. I have been a customer for over a decade. They've gotten unreasonably bad. I am leaving no matter what.

Questions:

\- What can I do here?

\- Do you know of anyone else like ATT/Verizon buying out contracts?
